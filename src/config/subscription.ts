 *    (same access, only the billing period differs).
 *  - 7-day free trial, once per couple, no card required (server-granted). During
 *    the trial the couple gets a TASTE: 5 swipes + 5 groups, no group creation.
 *  - After paying (monthly or yearly), Sawa Prime is FULL access: unlimited
 *    swipes, unlimited group joins, and can create their own groups.
 *  - Entitlement is per COUPLE: either partner's purchase unlocks both.
